/**
 * Reolink Integration (Parent App)
 * Version: 1.6.1
 *
 * Architecture: a "source" is anything answering the Reolink HTTP/JSON API
 * (standalone camera, PoE NVR, or Home Hub), each with its own IP + creds. A
 * multi-channel source (NVR/Hub) reports channels 0..N-1; a standalone camera
 * is a degenerate source with one channel: 0. Every child device is tagged
 * (sourceId, channel) and talks only through parent.componentX() -- never
 * HTTP directly. Poll interval is per-child (wired 2-5s tight, battery loose)
 * to avoid hammering sleeping devices. Each source is fronted by a "Reolink
 * Device Bridge" device (one per source) that holds the persistent real-time
 * event subscription and is the real parent of Camera/Doorbell, so they nest
 * under it in the Devices list. Event-driven updates are the standard path;
 * a source falls back to polling automatically on connection loss and
 * silently resumes event mode on reconnect.
 *
 * Device-specific findings/limitations/setup gotchas live in the README and
 * in-app Tips page, not duplicated here. TODO markers mark spots needing
 * exact command/param names verified against firmware (field names can
 * drift by version). Full history prior to 1.3.6 is in GitHub commit history.
 *
 * v1.6.1 -- Pass RTSP port and output width defaults when configuring newly
 * created children so the doorbell driver saves all stream settings at creation.
 *
 * BREAKING CHANGE (v1.3.8): every camera/doorbell became a child of a new
 * per-source "Reolink Device Bridge" instead of a child of this app directly
 * -- existing installs had to delete/recreate devices (and repoint
 * dashboards/rules) via re-discovery under each source.
 *
 * v1.5.3 -- HOTFIX: found during a real production outage where a Home
 * Hub's entire shared event connection (all channels) silently died for
 * 5 days with zero log trace, while still self-reporting "connected."
 * Root cause: the 90s stale-connection watchdog documented in the 1.4.4
 * history below was lost at some point during the 1.5.0 recording-control
 * rewrite (confirmed absent from the actual sendKeepalive() code in
 * ReolinkDeviceBridge.groovy) -- with it gone, a half-open TCP connection
 * (remote side or a router's NAT mapping disappears without a proper
 * close/error) could sit indefinitely reporting healthy with nothing to
 * catch it. A related bug in the same method (sendKeepalive() returning
 * early on a stage change without rescheduling itself) meant even the
 * ordinary keepalive loop could silently stop running under the right
 * conditions.
 * Fixed: the staleness watchdog is restored (ReolinkDeviceBridge.groovy
 * tracks a real last-message timestamp, sendKeepalive() checks it every
 * cycle and forces a reconnect past 90s of silence), and sendKeepalive()
 * now always reschedules itself regardless of which branch it takes.
 * Also added a new, structurally independent audit job (auditEventConnections(),
 * app-level, every 15 minutes via Hubitat's own schedule() rather than this
 * app's runIn chain) that double-checks every source's real liveness and
 * force-reconnects any source its own watchdog missed -- a second layer
 * specifically because the first layer already failed silently once in
 * production.
 * Logging refined after real-world feedback: detecting staleness and
 * starting a reconnect is routine (could just be a transient IP/network
 * blip) and now stays silent by default; log.warn only fires if a
 * reconnect needs a SECOND attempt, and giving up after all 10 attempts
 * is now log.error, not log.warn, since that's the one outcome that
 * actually needs attention. The Full-logging auto-revert (60 minutes)
 * now reverts to Errors Only instead of Normal, matching this app's
 * actual default.
 *
 * v1.5.2 -- HOTFIX: discoverPage()'s per-channel checkbox self-heal logic
 * (added to correct a stale-checked checkbox left over when a device was
 * deleted outside the app -- see the Tips page's "Deleting a device the
 * wrong way" topic) could not distinguish that case from "a brand-new
 * channel the user just toggled on, not yet applied." Both look identical
 * to that check: no device currently exists for this DNI, and the checkbox
 * is true. Since every channel checkbox reposts the page on change
 * (submitOnChange: true), toggling on a never-before-created channel on a
 * multi-channel Hub/NVR source triggered the self-heal on the very next
 * render and silently reset the checkbox back to false before Apply could
 * ever be clicked -- reported as new channels "bouncing back to
 * unselected" and never becoming selectable. Single-channel standalone
 * sources were unaffected (they apply immediately on toggle, no repost in
 * between), and any ALREADY-created device was unaffected (exists == true
 * skips the check entirely regardless of registry state).
 * Fixed by adding a persistent per-app registry (state.knownDeviceDnis) of
 * every DNI this app has actually created at least once. The self-heal
 * check now only fires for a DNI that's genuinely in that registry --
 * i.e. a device that existed and was removed some other way -- never for
 * a channel that's simply never been created yet. markDeviceEverCreated()
 * is called the moment a channel device is actually created;
 * forgetDeviceEverCreated() is called both on an intentional removal
 * (createSelectedChildren()'s uncheck-and-apply path, so re-adding that
 * channel later behaves like a fresh add, not a stale-checkbox case) and
 * on full source removal (removeSource()), alongside the existing
 * forgetSchedulingState() cleanup.
 *
 * v1.5.0 -- NVR recording control: a master record on/off switch, plus
 * named per-channel schedule presets loaded on demand. Confirmed against a
 * real RLN16-410 NVR (6 Elite Wifi floodlights + 1 Gen2 battery wifi
 * doorbell, hub is a C-8 Pro) across many rounds of live testing before
 * release.
 *  - componentSetRecordingEnabled() flips the NVR's master record switch
 *    (SetRecV20 with NO channel field) -- CONFIRMED this call is genuinely
 *    untargeted at the API level: it always applies to every channel of the
 *    source at once, there is no per-channel version of it. The per-camera
 *    "Enable Record" screen in the Reolink app does nothing for NVR-side
 *    recording; it only controls onboard SD-card recording, which these
 *    cameras don't have.
 *  - componentLoadPreset() writes a named, per-channel 168-char hourly
 *    schedule (defined on the in-app Recording Presets page) to the NVR,
 *    one channel at a time, via a fresh read-modify-write (fetch the
 *    channel's current full schedule, flip only the relevant field(s),
 *    send the whole thing back) -- CONFIRMED a minimal/partial Rec object
 *    is silently accepted (rspCode 200) but produces NO actual change, so
 *    the full read-modify-write is required, not optional. A channel with
 *    no string saved for a given preset is skipped entirely, which is how
 *    a battery-class channel (e.g. a WiFi doorbell) stays excluded from a
 *    preset meant for wired channels.
 *  - A permanent per-device "Exclude from ALL recording presets" lock
 *    (excludeFromRecordingPresets on the Camera/Doorbell drivers) is
 *    enforced here inside componentLoadPreset() -- a locked channel is
 *    skipped on every preset load regardless of what that preset specifies
 *    for it, distinct from the ordinary "skipped (no data)" case (a
 *    channel simply left blank in one particular preset). presetsPage()
 *    greys out a locked channel's picker with a 🔒 instead of rendering an
 *    editable input for it. Direct manual commands aimed at a locked
 *    device are unaffected -- only preset-driven writes are blocked.
 *  - Schedule API generation: GetRecV20 is tried first regardless of any
 *    GetAbility capability flag, falling back to classic GetRec only if
 *    V20 itself returns no usable value -- CONFIRMED GetAbility's own
 *    scheduleVersion field doesn't reliably predict which generation a
 *    given NVR actually needs. scheduleEnable is a TOP-LEVEL field on Rec
 *    (sibling to "schedule"), NOT nested inside schedule.enable -- source:
 *    reading reolink_aio's (Home Assistant's Reolink integration library)
 *    actual set_recording() implementation, confirmed against real raw
 *    schedule dumps. Every key already present in the device's OWN
 *    returned schedule.table gets set, rather than assuming a specific key
 *    name like "TIMING" -- real hardware showed this can't be assumed.
 *  - Ordering: the master enable call must fire AFTER every per-channel
 *    schedule write, not before -- CONFIRMED writing a per-channel
 *    schedule silently re-flips the master enable flag back on as a side
 *    effect, so sending master-enable=0 before per-channel writes gets
 *    undone by them. A ~300ms pause between per-channel writes
 *    (REC_CHANNEL_SETTLE_MS) is also required -- back-to-back writes
 *    closer together than that produced intermittent per-channel misses
 *    on real hardware (6 WiFi floodlight channels).
 *  - Preset button numbers (componentBridgeButtonPushed(),
 *    getOrAssignButtonNumber()/retireButtonNumber()) are assigned once per
 *    preset, permanently, from a per-source counter that never resets or
 *    reuses a retired number -- deliberately avoids a positional/numbered-
 *    button scheme's fragility: a deleted preset's old Rule Machine
 *    trigger just goes inert instead of ever silently firing whatever
 *    different preset happens to reuse its old number.
 *  - The Recording Presets page's default UI is a plain-language picker
 *    (Continuous / "Never record" / a daily time range / don't manage)
 *    that generates the 168-char string automatically; an opt-in
 *    "Advanced" toggle reveals the raw string field for a schedule the
 *    simple picker can't express. "Don't manage" leaves whatever schedule
 *    already exists untouched; "Never record" actively writes an all-zero
 *    schedule -- a real distinction the reporting user's own workaround
 *    surfaced during development.
 *  - checkRecordingSchedule() is a read-only diagnostic (Camera/Doorbell
 *    drivers and their bridge/standalone passthroughs) that reads and logs
 *    a channel's current schedule without writing anything -- useful for
 *    confirming a channel's schedule shape before defining a preset
 *    against it.
 *  - Two earlier designs were built, tested, and fully abandoned during
 *    development in favor of the above: a cache-and-restore recording
 *    toggle (replayed a schedule snapshot from the first time it was ever
 *    used, which went stale the moment a real custom schedule was set
 *    later), and a set of separate virtual child devices for the master
 *    switch/preset buttons (replaced by adding Switch/PushableButton
 *    capabilities directly to the bridge itself, since exactly one bridge
 *    already exists per source). Neither exists in the code anymore.
 *  - Two confirmed Hubitat/Rule Machine platform quirks worth remembering
 *    for future driver work: (1) a bridge command declared with
 *    description-only metadata (no real argument) renders fine on that
 *    device's own Commands tab, but Rule Machine's Custom Action treats it
 *    as a real argument slot and passes through whatever's typed -- a risk
 *    for any genuinely zero-argument command (on()/off()/
 *    loadSelectedPreset() are declared bare for this reason; see
 *    ReolinkDeviceBridge.groovy). (2) Rule Machine hands a NUMBER-type
 *    command argument to a method as BigDecimal, not Integer, and Groovy
 *    does not auto-coerce between them in that call context -- push(btn)
 *    takes BigDecimal accordingly.
 *
 * v1.3.6 through v1.4.5 (condensed, full detail in GitHub commit history):
 * discoverPage() checkbox-toggle fixes and clearer wording; standalone
 * (non-Hub) camera/doorbell support, later found in testing to need a
 * Home Hub or NVR after all (see the "Standalone battery-device support,
 * closed" note below); PIR enable/disable; real-time event-driven updates
 * over a persistent Baichuan subscription, falling back to polling
 * automatically; several scheduler/battery-check gating bugs found via
 * real hardware and fixed (stuck batteryMode, stale due-times surviving
 * an upgrade); a DuplicateDNIException crash on orphaned devices caught
 * gracefully; explicit uninstalled() teardown added rather than relying
 * on Hubitat's implicit cascade-delete.
